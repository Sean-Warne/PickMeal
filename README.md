# PickMeal

A simple script to generate a meal plan from a list of recipes contained in a JSON file. This will eventually be replaced by a Django app but alas, it's Saturday evening, I need a meal plan for Sunday, and have no time to create a full-featured web app. 

## Execution

From root directory, run:
`python pickmeal.py meals.json`
